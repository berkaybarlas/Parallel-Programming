Exercise-1: Hello World with CUDA

Credit: Mark Ebersole - NVIDIA Corporation

Description:
A very simple Hello World designed to help demonstrate the high parallelism
available in a modern GPU.

Compile:
Using the NVIDIA C Compiler
  nvcc  -arch=sm_20 -o hello hello.cu
or 
  make 

Instructions:
- Compile and run the code 
- Comment out the first part of the code and Comment in the second part of the code
- Compile and Run, what do you observe?
- Change 12 to 16, what happens?
hello<<< 1, 12>>>();
- Change 1 to 2, what happens?
hello<<< 2, 12>>>();
- Change both, what happens?
hello<<< 2, 16>>>();

Observations:
Compile and run the code 
       CPU prints hello world but GPU does nothing.
Comment out the first part of the code and comment in the second part of the code
Compile and Run, what do you observe?
       This prints hello world â€“ one character in each line
Change 12 to 16, what happens?
       There are more threads than characters in the string, some characters are printed twice!
Change 1 to 2, what happens?
       Two thread blocks are created, the message is printed twice
Change both, what happens?
       Both 4 and 5 occur, some characters are printed twice, and the message is printed twice.
